# Softkanban

I was pretty tired of naming my SFDC project sfXXX, so i replaced the sf for soft.

## Kanban example

![use example](./readme-resources/chrome-capture-2022-5-18.gif)

(I used some random gif recorder chrome extension, limited to 10 seconds and it doesn't capture the movement, but it is there -.-)

I still have pending working on the UI, and adapt it to accomplish the SLDS guidelines.

## How to use

The LWC softKanban is exposed to lightning tabs, create a new one and use the LWC on it.
